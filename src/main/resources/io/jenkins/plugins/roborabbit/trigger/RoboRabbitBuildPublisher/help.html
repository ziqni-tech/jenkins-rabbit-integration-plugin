<h1>Robo Rabbit AMQP Build Publisher</h1>
<p>
    This feature publishes build results to an AMQP exchange, allowing you to send build status updates and logs to external systems via RabbitMQ.

    <strong>Configuration:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><b>Exchange Name:</b> The name of the exchange to which the build result will be published.</li>
    <li><b>Routing Key:</b> Specify a routing key that determines which queue the message should be delivered to.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Published JSON Format:</strong>
    Below is an example of the JSON format that gets published:
<pre><code>
    {
        "project": "ExampleProject",
        "number": 123,
        "status": "SUCCESS"
    }
    </code></pre>
<strong>Status Options:</strong>
The following are the possible values for the <code>status</code> field:
<ul>
    <li><code>SUCCESS</code> - The build completed successfully.</li>
    <li><code>UNSTABLE</code> - The build completed with some issues (e.g., failing tests).</li>
    <li><code>FAILURE</code> - The build failed.</li>
    <li><code>NOT_BUILT</code> - The build was not run.</li>
    <li><code>ABORTED</code> - The build was manually stopped before completion.</li>
</ul>

    The publisher provides a way to share build outcomes with other services or trigger subsequent tasks in your CI/CD pipeline.
