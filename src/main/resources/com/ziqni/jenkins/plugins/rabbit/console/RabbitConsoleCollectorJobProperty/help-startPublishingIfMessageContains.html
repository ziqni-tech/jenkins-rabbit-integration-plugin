<h1>Start Publishing if Message Contains</h1>
<p>
    This function inspects text being printed to the console and triggers publishing if a specified case-sensitive string is found.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong>
    The function enables conditional publishing of console output to an AMQP exchange. When the specified string is detected in the console output, it initiates publishing of all subsequent messages, including the message that triggered the action.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Configuration:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><b>Case-Sensitive String:</b> Provide the exact string that will trigger publishing. The function will look for this string in a case-sensitive manner.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example Usage:</strong>
    If the string "<code>ERROR:</code>" is specified, the function will start publishing all console messages once a line containing "ERROR:" appears.
</p>
<p>
    This feature is useful for starting conditional publishing based on specific log outputs, such as errors or significant events, without flooding the AMQP channel with unnecessary logs.
