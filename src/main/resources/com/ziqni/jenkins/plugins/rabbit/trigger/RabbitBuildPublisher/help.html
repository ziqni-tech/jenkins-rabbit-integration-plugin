<h1>RabbitMQ Build Publisher</h1>
<p>
    This feature publishes build results to an AMQP exchange, allowing you to send build status updates and logs to external systems via RabbitMQ.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Configuration:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><b>Exchange Name:</b> The name of the exchange to which the build result will be published.</li>
    <li><b>Routing Key:</b> Specify a routing key that determines which queue the message should be delivered to.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Published JSON Format:</strong>
    Below is an example of the JSON format that gets published:
<pre><code>
    {
        "project": "ExampleProject",
        "number": 123,
        "status": "SUCCESS"
    }
    </code></pre>
<strong>Status Options:</strong>
The following are the possible values for the <code>status</code> field:
<ul>
    <li><code>SUCCESS</code> - The build completed successfully.</li>
    <li><code>UNSTABLE</code> - The build completed with some issues (e.g., failing tests).</li>
    <li><code>FAILURE</code> - The build failed.</li>
    <li><code>NOT_BUILT</code> - The build was not run.</li>
    <li><code>ABORTED</code> - The build was manually stopped before completion.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    The publisher provides a way to share build outcomes with other services or trigger subsequent tasks in your CI/CD pipeline.

<h2>RabbitMQ Message Properties</h2>
<p>This section describes the properties that are extracted and made available by the <code>RabbitMessageProperties</code> class. These properties correspond to various metadata fields related to messages received from a RabbitMQ queue.</p>

<h3>Basic RabbitMQ Message Properties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_QUEUE_NAME}:</strong> The name of the queue from which the message was received.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_EXCHANGE}:</strong> The name of the exchange through which the message was routed.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_ROUTING_KEY}:</strong> The routing key used to deliver the message.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_DELIVERY_TAG}:</strong> A unique identifier for the message delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_REDELIVERED}:</strong> A flag indicating whether the message has been redelivered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Content and Header Properties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_CONTENT_TYPE}:</strong> The content type of the message payload (e.g., <code>text/plain</code>, <code>application/json</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_CONTENT_ENCODING}:</strong> The encoding type used for the message content (e.g., <code>UTF-8</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_HEADER_}:</strong> A prefix for all custom headers included with the message. The specific header names are appended to this prefix.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Delivery and Metadata Properties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_DELIVERY_MODE}:</strong> The delivery mode of the message, indicating whether it is persistent (2) or non-persistent (1).</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_PRIORITY}:</strong> The priority level of the message.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_CORRELATION_ID}:</strong> An ID used to correlate this message with another message (typically used in RPC-style communication).</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_REPLY_TO}:</strong> An address to which a response can be sent if required.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_EXPIRATION}:</strong> The expiration time of the message (in milliseconds).</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_MESSAGE_ID}:</strong> A unique identifier assigned to the message.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_TIMESTAMP}:</strong> The timestamp when the message was sent (in UNIX epoch format).</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_TYPE}:</strong> A message type identifier, often used to specify the kind of message being sent.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_USER_ID}:</strong> The user ID associated with the message.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_APP_ID}:</strong> The ID of the application that published the message.</li>
    <li><strong>${RABBIT_CLUSTER_ID}:</strong> An identifier for the RabbitMQ cluster.</li>
</ul>
