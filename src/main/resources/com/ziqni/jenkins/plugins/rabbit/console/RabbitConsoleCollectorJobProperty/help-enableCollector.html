    <h3>Enable Console Collector</h3>
    <p>
        This checkbox allows you to enable or disable the console collector functionality for this job.
    </p>
    <p>
        When enabled, the plugin will collect and process console logs for this build, providing additional features such as message publishing to RabbitMQ.
        This may be useful for integrating Jenkins job outputs with external systems that require information about the job's status and details.
    </p>
    <p>
        If disabled, all associated settings (like Broker Name and Routing Key) will be ignored, and the plugin will not interact with RabbitMQ for this job.
    </p>

    <h2>RabbitMQ Headers</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to the custom message template, the following RabbitMQ headers will also be set when publishing the message:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>line-number</strong>: The current line number in the console log.</li>
        <li><strong>job-name</strong>: The number of the Jenkins job.</li>
        <li><strong>display-name</strong>: The display name of the current run.</li>
        <li><strong>stop-message-console</strong>: Indicates whether to stop the message from being displayed in the console. If publishing is enabled, this value will be set to <code>false</code>, otherwise it will be set to <code>true</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These headers provide additional context for the published messages, which can be used for further processing or filtering on the RabbitMQ side.
    </p>
