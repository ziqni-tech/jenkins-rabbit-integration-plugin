    <h3>Enable Console Collector</h3>
    <p>
        This checkbox allows you to enable or disable the console collector functionality for this job.
    </p>
    <p>
        When enabled, the plugin will collect and process console logs for this build, providing additional features such as message publishing to RabbitMQ.
        This may be useful for integrating Jenkins job outputs with external systems that require information about the job's status and details.
    </p>
    <p>
        If disabled, all associated settings (like Broker Name and Routing Key) will be ignored, and the plugin will not interact with RabbitMQ for this job.
    </p>
