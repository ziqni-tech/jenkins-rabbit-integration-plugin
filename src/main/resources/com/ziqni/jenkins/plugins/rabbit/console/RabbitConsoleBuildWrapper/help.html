    <h3>Enable Console Collector</h3>
    <p>
        This checkbox allows you to enable or disable the console collector functionality for this job.
    </p>
    <p>
        When enabled, the plugin will collect and process console logs for this build, providing additional features such as message publishing to RabbitMQ.
        This may be useful for integrating Jenkins job outputs with external systems that require information about the job's status and details.
    </p>
    <p>
        If disabled, all associated settings (like Broker Name and Routing Key) will be ignored, and the plugin will not interact with RabbitMQ for this job.
    </p>

    <h2>RabbitMQ Headers</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to the custom message template, the following RabbitMQ headers will also be set when publishing the message:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>line-number</strong>: The current line number in the console log.</li>
        <li><strong>job-name</strong>: The number of the Jenkins job.</li>
        <li><strong>display-name</strong>: The display name of the current run.</li>
        <li><strong>stop-message-console</strong>: Indicates whether to stop the message from being displayed in the console. If publishing is enabled, this value will be set to <code>false</code>, otherwise it will be set to <code>true</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These headers provide additional context for the published messages, which can be used for further processing or filtering on the RabbitMQ side.
    </p>

    <h2>RabbitMQ Message Properties</h2>
    <p>This section describes the properties that are extracted and made available by the <code>RabbitMessageProperties</code> class. These properties correspond to various metadata fields related to messages received from a RabbitMQ queue.</p>

    <h3>Basic RabbitMQ Message Properties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_QUEUE_NAME}:</strong> The name of the queue from which the message was received.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_EXCHANGE}:</strong> The name of the exchange through which the message was routed.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_ROUTING_KEY}:</strong> The routing key used to deliver the message.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_DELIVERY_TAG}:</strong> A unique identifier for the message delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_REDELIVERED}:</strong> A flag indicating whether the message has been redelivered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Content and Header Properties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_CONTENT_TYPE}:</strong> The content type of the message payload (e.g., <code>text/plain</code>, <code>application/json</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_CONTENT_ENCODING}:</strong> The encoding type used for the message content (e.g., <code>UTF-8</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_HEADER_}:</strong> A prefix for all custom headers included with the message. The specific header names are appended to this prefix.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Delivery and Metadata Properties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_DELIVERY_MODE}:</strong> The delivery mode of the message, indicating whether it is persistent (2) or non-persistent (1).</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_PRIORITY}:</strong> The priority level of the message.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_CORRELATION_ID}:</strong> An ID used to correlate this message with another message (typically used in RPC-style communication).</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_REPLY_TO}:</strong> An address to which a response can be sent if required.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_EXPIRATION}:</strong> The expiration time of the message (in milliseconds).</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_MESSAGE_ID}:</strong> A unique identifier assigned to the message.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_TIMESTAMP}:</strong> The timestamp when the message was sent (in UNIX epoch format).</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_TYPE}:</strong> A message type identifier, often used to specify the kind of message being sent.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_USER_ID}:</strong> The user ID associated with the message.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_APP_ID}:</strong> The ID of the application that published the message.</li>
        <li><strong>${RABBIT_CLUSTER_ID}:</strong> An identifier for the RabbitMQ cluster.</li>
    </ul>
